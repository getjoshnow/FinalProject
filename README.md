About: 'Go Orbital!' is a international - interplantary travel booking website created in a eight-day sprint.  The website is allows the user to purchase luxury travel vacations to exotic destinations.  The user can browse existing destination throughout the cosmos.

### How to use Go Orbital !:

Entering the site: Upon entering the site a user is shown a slideshow of available international interplantary destinations a navigation bar and information pertaining to the site and its developers at the bottom of the page.

Creating a user account: to use the full potential of 'Go Orbital!' a user must create a user account. When a user clicks on the Navigation Bar,  "Sign In" button, if the user does not already have a user account then the user is able to create a new account. The user is asked to enter the usual information sites need for an account including a unique username and password. Once the user enters the aforementioned information the site will persist the information into the 'Go Orbital!' database.  The Company profile allows a provider to create new trips they would like to sell on 'Go Orbital.'  Upon registering, the user's can add and remove trips as well as view comments on completed trips.  They can view their vehicles as well.

Creating, Updating and Deleting (CRUDing) operations are via the logged in user page: A user's logged in page will display any destinations a user has purchased. A user is able to view the details of that specific destination via the "view" button which takes them to the "trips" page. A Company user can update the details of that "trips" via the update button.

User and Logout Pages. When a user is logged in to the site they will see their name or whatever name they've given to create their accounts in the navigation bar. Clicking on their account name will take them to their user page. Clicking logout will log the user out and end their session thus making them a guest of the site.

Viewing the site as a non-account user: the functionality for non-account users is the same except they cannot purchase a trip to create destinations. The purpose of the non-account users is to allow prospective account holders to browse and gain interest.

### Goals Accomplished:

Created a basic functioning social networking site after 8 days of development.
Full Create Update and Delete (CRUD) functionality for users to add, update, and delete "space destinations" via their own personal user page.
All security protocols are met.

### Stretch Goals:

Allow users to add profile pictures via their local hard drive.
Allow users to login via Facebook, Twitter and Google Accounts accounts.
Develop a mobile application interface that allows the application to purchase from user's phone for maximum ease of use.

### Lessons Learned:

Don't work on on the master branch.  Push new code up frequently.
Communicate with team members often. remember effective communication can solve problems before they arise.
Understand team members' strengths and weaknesses and utilize their strengths and "swarm" on the areas where that individual is "blocked".
Refrain from implementing new Technologies during production.
Attempt to fully plan out the intended finished project with room for stretch goals within the database, otherwise it can be a challenge to alter data further along during project development we ran into this issue with user comments. and desired extra functionality.
