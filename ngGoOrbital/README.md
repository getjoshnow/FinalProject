### About:
  'Go Orbital' is a international interplanetary travel website created in a eight-day sprint designed a medium for customers to take destination vacations!  Our visual website informs and excites the customer about the exotic travel destinations.   Our application serves providers with the option of booking listings and offer serves. Our space-liners, see list of customers looking to visit the cosmos via their space vehicle.  

### How to use 'Go Orbital!':

Entering the site: Upon entering the site a user is shown gallery of destinations and news feeds about space related activities from the year 2035.  The user can navigation our website without logging in and see information pertaining destination, length, departure dates and requirements.  The footer contains contact information and Go Orbital developer information for assistance.

Creating a user account: to add, track and purchase vacation trips, a user must create a user account. When a user clicks on the Navigation bar "Sign In" button, if the user does not already have a user account, then the user is able to create a new account. The user is asked to indicate weather they are a traveler or a company trip provider.  

As a Traveler: the user enters their traveler information need for an account including a unique username and password. Once the user enters the aforementioned information the site will persist the information the user enters into the Go-Orbital database. On the profile page, a stock picture is able to be used as a placeholder and the user is able to upload a image by hovering over image. The user's profile will also display the date of account creation, the user's email address, and user metrics including upcoming trips. These travelers information is cumulative and persists throughout the user's account life.

As a Trip Provider: the user enters their company information for an account including a unique username and password. Once the user enters the aforementioned information the site will persist the information the user enters into the Go-Orbital database. On the Account profile page, a stock logo is able to be used as a placeholder and the user is able to upload a image by hovering over image. The user's profile will also display current information such as user's email address, metrics, trips and vehicles.

Creating, Updating and Deleting (CRUDing) "Vacation-trips" via the logged in user page: A user's logged in page will display any "parking-fails" a user has created. A user is able to view the details of that specific "car-fail" via the "view" button which takes them to the "parking-fail" page. A user can also update the details of that "parking-fail" via the update button attached to the bottom of the "parking-fail" photo.

### NAV-BAR: (more information will follow as the website solifies)
Gallery page:  see all trips

User and Logout Pages. When a user is logged in to the site they will see their name or company name.  to Their name will populate on Navigation bar. Clicking on their account name will take them to their user page. Clicking logout will log the user out and end their session thus making them a guest of the site.


Viewing the site as a non-account user: the functionality for non-account users is just browsing around. however non-account users are unable to comment or purchase trips from other users  The purpose of the non-account users is to allow prospective account holders or companies to inquire about our services.

### Goals Accomplished:

Created a basic functioning destination travel site after 8 days of development.
Full Create Update and Delete (CRUD) functionality for users to add, update, and delete trips via their own personal user page.

Allow 'Go Orbital' users to successfully book a trip.

### Stretch Goals:


Allow users to login via Facebook, Twitter and Google Accounts accounts.

Choose a launch-port based on user GEO location.
Internation Space Station location tracker.
Purchase additional training and sub extensions.

### Lessons Learned:

Communicate with team members often, effectively and with intent (be specific!) and attention to detail.
Attempt to fully plan out the intended finished project with room for stretch goals within the database, otherwise it can be a challenge to alter data further along during project development we ran into this issue with user comments on the "parking-fail" page
